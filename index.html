    <h2>Workshop Goals</h2>
    <p>
        We are delighted to announce the 2nd MBZUAI Workshop on Collaborative Learning focusing on the theme of "empowering sustainable futures". This is organized as part of the <a href="https://www.cop28.com/en/"><b>28 UN Climate Change Conference</b></a> and aims to delve into how federated/collaborative learning could aid towards sustainable development goals, as well as provide a venue for dissseminating state of the art collaborative learning research.
    </p>

    <p>
        The pursuit of sustainable development has become a global priority as societies strive to ensure a harmonious coexistence between economic growth, social well-being, and environmental preservation. However, much of the data required for this purpose is sensitive, belonging to individuals or organizations that are understandably reluctant to share it due to concerns about privacy, security, and potential misuse. In fact, the UN “Global Pulse” initiative has identified lack of data access to be the key bottleneck for unleashing AI for achieving SDGs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Collaborative and federated learning presents a perfect solution to such issues. This workshop aims to understand and realize the potential of collaborative and federated learning to address concerns of privacy, autonomy, and inclusiveness with an aim towards enabling a sustainable future.
    </p>

    <h2>Areas of Focus</h2>
    <p>
        We invite contributions on topics broadly related to collaborative learning, data sharing, data markets, and decentralized surveillance. We welcome both technical work as well as showcasing of applications to SDGs. The goals and expected outcomes from the workshop are to:
    </p>    
    
        <ol>
            <li>Share new research and developments in collaborative and federated learning.</li>
            <li>Increase awareness of the potential of federated learning to support the SDGs.</li>
            <li>Identify challenges and opportunities for federated learning in the context of the SDGs.</li>
          </ol>
    
        
    <p>
        We believe that the 2nd MBZUAI Workshop on Collaborative Learning in the context of sustainability will provide a unique platform to explore the transformative potential of federated learning, promote cross-domain collaboration, and inspire innovative solutions that contribute to the realization of the SDGs. We eagerly anticipate the participation of the MBZUAI community and beyond to make this workshop a resounding success.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    <p>
        We will host two days of invited talks (Dec 9-10) interspersed with panel discussions on challenges in collaborative learning. On the third day (Dec 11), there will be an optional half-day visit to a local heritage site offered for the workshop spakers.
    </p>
    <p>
        This will be followed by transfers to the airport for departing flights.
